# Pantograph Mechanism Kinematics and PRBM Study

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the analysis of a pantograph mechanism's kinematics and a Pseudo-Rigid Body Model (PRBM) study to investigate the design parameters of compliant joints.

## Overview

A pantograph mechanism is a mechanical linkage system composed of rigid bars connected by hinged joints. This study aims to analyze the pantograph mechanism's kinematics, focusing on the transmission ratio between two linear movements, and conduct a PRBM study to understand the design parameters of compliant joints.

## Features

- **Kinematic Analysis**: Analysis of the pantograph mechanism to understand the relationship between input and output movements.
- **Transmission Ratio**: Calculation and exploration of the transmission ratio in the pantograph mechanism.
- **PRBM Study**: Detailed PRBM study for efficient and accurate analysis of compliant structures.
- **Compliant Joint Analysis**: Investigation of various types of compliant joints and their impact on the mechanism's performance.

## Requirements

- Python
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`
